\section{Conclusion}
We showed a novel approach for edge labeling where we use the image and depth map from 
an RGBD sensor (Kinect). We label the Pb edges with occluding, planar, convex and 
concave labels. We developed a boundary classification algorithm using Random forest. 
The use of pairwise potentials in an MRF produces only marginal improvement. In real 
images, the constraints that can be derived from pairwise potentials seem 
difficult to use due to the presence of noisy and incomplete boundary pixels. Overall, 
our algorithm provides good labels for most pixels and the performance degrades 
when there is a significant loss in the depth data. In future, we plan to focus on 
using only RGB image for obtaining this classification. Code and the dataset for this 
paper can be found at: \url{https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/semanticBoundaries}
